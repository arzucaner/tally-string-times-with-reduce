# Tally String Times with Reduce

---

## In this project, Wes Bos challenges learners to use the JavaScript array method reduce() to create a program that takes in an array of strings representing times in the format "minutes:seconds" and calculates the total time in minutes and seconds.

The program should be able to handle any number of time strings, including those with minutes greater than 60. The final output should be a string representing the total time in the same format as the input, with minutes and seconds separated by a colon.

To complete the challenge, learners will need to use the reduce() method to iterate over the array of time strings and accumulate the total time in seconds. They will then need to convert the total time in seconds to minutes and seconds and format the output as a string.

Wes Bos provides a starting point for the project, including a sample array of time strings and some starter code to help learners get started. However, learners will need to use their knowledge of JavaScript and the reduce() method to complete the challenge and create a fully functional program.

Overall, the "Tally String Times with Reduce" challenge is a great way to practice using the reduce() method in a real-world application and to deepen one's understanding of how arrays and iteration work in JavaScript.
